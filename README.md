# Euclidean Algorithm Implementation

## Objective
This project implements the Euclidean Algorithm to compute the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers efficiently. It also extends to the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which finds integer coefficients for Bézout's identity, crucial for modular inverses in RSA cryptography.

## Skills Learned
- Understanding of number theory and greatest common divisor (GCD) calculations  
- Implementing the Euclidean Algorithm and its extended version in Java  
- Applying modular arithmetic for cryptographic applications  
- Working with recursion and iterative approaches in algorithm design  

## Tools Used
- Java (for coding the algorithm)  
- Eclipse IDE (for development and debugging)  
- JUnit Testing (for verifying correctness of implementations)  

## Implementation Details
The program consists of multiple components:
1. Euclidean Algorithm Function: Computes the GCD of two numbers using recursion and iteration.  
2. Extended Euclidean Algorithm Function: Determines integer coefficients for Bézout's identity.  
3. RSA Key Generation Utility: Uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to compute modular inverses for RSA cryptography.  
4. Input Handling Module: Reads input from the user or external files to test algorithm efficiency.  
5. Performance Analyzer: Compares iterative vs. recursive approaches for runtime efficiency.
